# jsnabi
jsnabi aims to be a simple turn-based cooperative game playable on web browsers.
The design is heavily inspired by [Hanabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game))

## Why
To try the beta of [AngularJS 2](https://angular.io/) out from scratch.
A playful implementation of a light strategy game seemed fit for the project.

## Trivia
jsnabi is Hanabi shifted right:
- J and S keys are adjacent to the right to H and A (on a qwerty keyboard).
- It's implemented in JavaScript.
