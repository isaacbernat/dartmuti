# Dartmuti
Dartmuti aims to be a simple turn-based game playable on web browsers.
The design is heavily inspired by [The Great Dalumti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Dalmuti).
The previous is based on [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(card_game))
also known by the names of *Capitalism* and *Asshole* among others.
And this game shares many similarities with [Dai Hin Min](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dai_Hin_Min) which in turn resembles other games as well.

## Why
To try the beta of [AngularJS 2](https://angular.io/) out from scratch.
More specifically the [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) implementation of said framework.
A playful light card game seemed fit for the project.
